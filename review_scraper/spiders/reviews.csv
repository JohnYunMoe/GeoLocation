Bu Tafish,"24.451642,54.3341759",EARL UNLIMITED,101834365549089978061,"This restaurant impressed me with its first impression! The place is clean, spacious, and beautifully decorated - perfect for capturing stunning photos. The tables and chairs look expensive and stylish, adding to the overall luxurious feel.
The service was excellent!  (I forgot the staff name,He was friendly and attentive)  However, there was a bit of a language barrier as the staff didn't speak much English. Thankfully, we had an Arabic friend with us who helped bridge the gap.  (the restaurant offers menus in english but you need to scan a code to acces their menu)
We ordered a seafood bucket, one with chili flavor and one with saffron. The overflowing sauce was delicious, and the saffron flavor was particularly good.  The shrimp were large and juicy, a definite highlight.  However, some of the seafood was a bit disappointing. The mussels were soggy and almost dissolved, and the lobster meat was tough and didn't taste quite fresh.  The crab meat was also inconsistent - some pieces were nicely cooked and juicy, while others were mushy.
Overall, the ambiance and service were top-notch, and the food had its high points.  However, the inconsistency with the seafood quality brought the rating down a notch.  A minor point, but the water was also quite expensive.  They did accept coupons we found on Instagram, which was a nice perk.  There's also free valet parking, which is a big plus.  I'd recommend this restaurant if you want instagramable shots, but keep in mind the potential for some variability in the seafood freshness.

The Food: Average food. Some dishes are great, some are ok, and some are horrible, it‚Äôs a hit or miss. Quality ingredients and a menu that offer a variety of Asian dishes.
The Service: Good service. What you would expect from a restaurant like this.
The Atmosphere: Great interior design and lovely seating area. However, loud music is blasting through the speakers. Sometimes the music is calm and goes well with the vibe of the place, and other times the music is loud, weird selection of music.
Overall, I would give this restaurant a higher review if not for the pricing. A pricing scheme that makes it seem like a 5 star restaurant but doesn‚Äôt quite justify it with the food, service, and atmosphere.

We also tried the mixed kebab platter which was another stellar dish and worth a try if you are a kebab lover. All the meats were tender and juicy. There is also a vegetarian version of this.
As there are so many options, we decided to order Ghee Roast Chicken with Chettinad sauce and Dab Moilee curry. It had a perfect amount of spiciness and thickening in the gravy, just how we like it!
I would like to thank the staff for selecting the right dishes for us.

Also, mutton biryani is definitely worth trying. There was nothing short of amazing about it. Everything was perfect - the taste, the texture of the rice, the fragrance, the succulent meat, and the quantity. This dish definitely deserves a 10/10.

Being in Nation Tower this restaurant has lined up the Menu worth attracting the local and Arab patrons. Tastes and spices have also been adjusted accordingly in the predominant Indian dishes.
Though the vegetarian spread is limited but we weren‚Äôt disappointed. Best was the Grilled Watermelon Ricotta Cheese Salad. Ummm‚Ä¶ the salad was bursting with myriad of flavors. Sweet watermelon, salty cheese, sharp n pungent rocket leaves, juicy strawberry, apples, seeds and pomegranates and tangy dressing. Loved it‚Ä¶.
In the main-course we had ordered jackfruit curry (kathal) n daal makhani. Jackfruit preparation was good and distinct jackfruit taste was relishable amidst the not so spicy curry. The coating of jackfruit though was thicker. The coating done while frying should be delicate and thin. Daal Makhani was quite good and upto the Peppermill standard.
We reached the restaurant at 10:30 pm and was completely empty and nearing the closing time. Shameem seated us with full courtesy and waited on us patiently beyond the closing hours. Full marks to him. He had complete knowledge of the dishes featured in the menu and answered all my detailed queries about the ingredients etc to my satisfaction.

We were the only table eating at the restaurant as everyone else was just having coffee.
We had millet beetroot salad, burrata salad, sweet and sour brisket, sirloin steak, grilled corn fed chicken and truffle pumpkin risotto.
The grilled corn fed chicken included the skin and bones so it wasn‚Äôt super easy to eat, and the taste was average. The truffle pumpkin risotto was tasty if you like the taste of truffles! The sirloin steak was overcooked as we asked for medium well done but got it well done.
For the dessert, we had the cheesecake which was extremely fresh and tasty and the triple chocolate brownie which was a little average. All the coffee drinks we ordered weren‚Äôt great (mocha, latte, flat white) but the only nice drink was the dialogue latte.

It is because of the service and incident that has occurred to me yesterday.
We have decided to have a quick bite at this Libanese restaurant after we have visited the hotel with a visitor.
We have arrived to the restaurant and the lady from Philippines at the entrance said hello sir, table for 3.. Do you have a reservation?
Well, please note that it was 4pm and the restaurant is huge and literally empty so I made a innocent joke saying hmm I dont think we need a reservation.. It is empty or are you  expecting many ppl at 4 pm? With a smile.. She replied with an arrogance I rarely see in Dubai by saying well sir to dine at the hotel you have to have a reservation and even at the door of the hotel sometimes they wont let you in if you dont have a reservation.. I have stopped her and said.. Dont give me false informations and you shouldn't argue with your  only client and with any client unless the words you are saying are at least relevant or true!
For those who never visited the hotel.. Take note that the hotel is open to all as long as you wear something nicely casual ( no shorts, tanks and flipflops) thats allllll... And it always has been this way even when I last visited for a drink 3 years ago!
I lookedat  her and said thats not true.. And she looked at me and said with a sarcastic smile.. Okkk its not.
I let go because I have spent a nice day and its worthless to make her day miserable as I was right!
I then knew that the hotel is undergoing a management shift and shall be under Mandarin Oriental soon.. GOOD because knowing the MO hotels.. A person with her attitude and her delusional facts will not DO!
The food is good snd and the rest of the team were ok although they seemed like they are doing as charity!
Very expensive for a Libanese and for that place!

And asked our dad to come because we love their food it was his first time. Last week on 17/2 we went to Abu Dhabi branch and it was awful experience definitely not visiting again!! And the staff and the manager are so bad don't know how to solve problems only making it worse.
We faced two problems, and both waitresses had an attitude!
First, they were serving the appetizers and main courses together! We haven‚Äôt finish the salad and the noodles were on the table already! They kept filling the table with plates and we were five and their tables are small so we were literally eating fast so other plates could fit in!!
We asked them to hold the other plates and both waitresses said ‚Äúthe food will come cold, and it‚Äôs not our problem if it tasted bad‚Äù The attitude!!! We called the manager and she took care of it.
Second, we paid and left and the waitress were running after us and said that the payment didn‚Äôt work we checked with the bank and it debited! She asked us to go back to the restaurant and we did. We asked them how come and it debited from our side, she didn‚Äôt explain a thing she said ‚Äúit okay it happened before we need you to pay again‚Äù !!! The manager comes to explain and she was making a scene!! Didn‚Äôt solve it made it worse and they were literally asking us to pay again! And they said ‚Äúthat this problem happened before 10 times at least with the machine you paid with‚Äù WHAT!!!! So you know the problem with the machine and still let us pay with it, they didn‚Äôt solve it my dad solve their own problem.
Even their customer service is bad i have been in contact with them in instagram since we left the restaurant and they said will updated me which they haven‚Äôt and asked for my contact number and that‚Äôs all and haven‚Äôt heard from them!

Corniche Street, Abu Dhabi.
We visited for family lunch.
It was empty, and having only another occupied table with couple of guests.
Staff are not welcoming neither professional as expected.
They are not attentive and not friendly at all.
Even the restaurant was empty, it was hard to get attention from any waiter or staff.
We had to look for a waiter and call for assistance anytime we need anything or we have any request.
No table visits was conducted, and we barely got attention from waiters.
Ordered items presentation was very good, but no appetizing.
We were disappointed by the quality and the taste was below expectations for such a fine dine levantine restaurant.
Kebbeh nayyeh was far away from the expectationst.
Soujouk with molasses was tasteless and the mix of taste was not matching with molasses.
Fatteh was below expectations and didn't taste good, just the makdous was ok, but the mix was awfully bad and extremely salty.
We had to ask many times for bread and when we asked it was delivered late.
Grilled chicken was good, some parts were over grilled was hard to chew for the kids.
Fries were good.
Dynamite shrimps had appearance and taste.
Most of the items tasted below expectations, and we didn't continue all the dishes.
Service is slow and bad.
Prices are fair but a total waste for such service and taste.
Atmosphere was good, it is very well decorated.
Unused table were not clean, and all of them were having mugs and water bottle marks on them and needed cleaning.
Outdoor sitting area need maintenance, but it seems nice to sit out in the evening.
Most probably won't return the visit.

The cafe has a tranquil vibe  the interior is very soothing. They have very high ceilings, a lot of natural daylight coming in, and earthy coloured interior and decorations. A great place to sit with friends to have a coffee. Or to sit and work. I ordered the Iced Matcha Latte, which is served with Almond Milk and Vanilla. The waitress was very proactive by informing me in advance about the vanilla in the Iced Matcha Latte, as it made the drink sweeter than a regular matcha, which can have a bitter taste, but I didnt find the vanilla overpowering.  It was well balanced. We also tried the Iced Nitro Tea, which was something I never had before. The Nitro Tea tasted refreshing and with the carbonation it had a different taste and sensation that a regular Iced Tea.
We also tried the Cheesecake, which was delicious by the way! It was in a good portion size. The flavours where very well balanced. The lemon flavour wasn't to sour not sweet. The caramel, small meringues and Berry compote created a nice flavour. We finished the Cheesecake very fast.
Besides the vibe, good food, and good service, I really liked that they have a wide variety of beverages. So there is plenty of different options that can suit anyone's taste. So if you aren't in the mood for coffee, there are teas, mocktails and juices, seltzer and more to choose from.
We paid in total AED112 for the 3 items.
There is free parking at the entrance of the park, which is nice too.  We will visit Dialogue again.",5.0,3 years ago,"c25a8433b3fe05ed32f34ac098c226,c8a7a9b84dce74029f5e6cb3ac23fb,16924492fbfdc5a6817dd140b38e4b,49e3ef5ba52112b76914f98287ae22"

We were sat at a wet table and asked for it to be cleaned twice as it was missed the first time. There are a lot of waiters and floor crew for such a small place with limited number of tables that you would always find two people standing there doing nothing / acting busy with nothing to do and making the room feel smaller.
We ordered a rose lychee lemonade and it was really good! Then we have started with an appetizer, crispy beef. It was alright as a start. You could easily taste the burnt oil even with the heat hiding it well and definitely needed the seseme to pop more. Then we had two main dishes, the first was a crispy chicken ramen. Which was awful. You are better off with a Wagamama Ramen or a storebought brand. And we also had a much better Malaysian Curry, it still was off as the spices were hidden by the heat and the coconut. And finally, we had the coco cloud for dessert which was good. We were surprised with two floor managers, no one bothered to ask us about the food.

After we put our name on the waiting list, you get a message with the link and you just keep tracking the time which is pretty useful). Moving on, I have heard so many people talk about how good the restaurant is, I have been dying to try it. I was actually pretty disappointed when entering the restaurant cause I didn‚Äôt expect it be this small! For such a great location, I would have expected it to be way bigger (it‚Äôs very cramped), but that obviously affect how good it is. The interior is stunning - simple, modern, and beautiful. We ordered their crispy beef, which me and my friend absolutely loved - personally I didn‚Äôt like the beef alone but with the mashed potato, I wouldn‚Äôt mind eating 10 of it! However, my other didn‚Äôt really like it, she thought it was too saucy. We also ordered their fried rice and it was super yummy. We also had their chicken tonkatsu - it was crispy and really good + their mi goreng (noodles) which I personally didn‚Äôt like but my friends really liked it. For drinks, my friend had their lychee rose lemonade - it was fizzy but she liked it. I had their strawberry mojito which was good. There were a lot of comments about how it‚Äôs overrated but honestly I don‚Äôt see it as overrated, it was different + genuinely really good and we would definitely go back to try their other things. The staff were super nice, they would come occasionally and ask if things were good and all that.

Service is excellent! Staff member Khalid was very welcoming, attended to our table regularly to check on us, and he took a suggestion from us in a very professional manner.
Food was very good. We ordered Mushroom and Chestnut Soup, which I think will become their signature if they really make the chestnut more present in the soup (I suggested they cut the chestnuts into larger pieces and add more of it to the soup cuz it was delicious). The Rocka and Mozzarella Balls Salad was also good especially with the crunch of the cheese balls and the hazelnuts, if they add walnuts on top it will take the dish to another level I think. Hummus with Kebbeh dish was my favourite, I loved the combination. Now the Mixed Grills dish was disappointing for me due to the quality of the meat. Kabab was greasy and the meat was chewy, also bulgur was lemony. This dish is overpriced (89dhs) given the quantity and the meat quality.

The ambiance is small and cozy, with dark decorations and soft lights, very pleasant. It may be difficult to read and appreciate the food, though. The music level, unfortunately, was a bit on the high side, when I came, and it was difficult to have a conversation.
The place is very popular with local youth, which makes it gets very crowded and quickly full. I am not sure whether distancing is fully implemented but the number of tables is maybe ten in total.
We had some sashimi, some nilgiri, two types of maki rolls, two types of yakitori skewers, a salad and two different types of noodles.
Sashimi selection was very limited (only salmon was available that night) and of average quality. So went for the nilgiri and maki, sushi rice was nice.
The skewers were interesting, although maybe the seasoning with sauces and seeds a bit overwhelming the taste of beef and chicken, but globally good.
Both noodles were excessively sweet. The preparation is eccentric and fashionable, with the noodles coming served aside a half coconut on the plate, which makes good IG photo opportunities. However, the level of sweetness, which may suggest maybe a Filipino cook is behind this dish(?), doesn't make justice to those dishes.
The total bill was around 600 AED.
The experience was globally ok, but I am not sure if I will come back.

*Bread with tomato. Delicious, toasted, but very little tomato and oil.
*Fat olives stuffed with orange. Original. The sweet orange offsets the vinegary touch of the olives.
*Omelette. We asked for it very rare, we insisted on it, and it arrived like a block, with the outside super caked. Inside, the few potatoes were looser, but everything was tremendously salty.
*Russian salad with belly. Awful. The belly was dry, not at all oily, and the salad was basically mayonnaise, the potatoes were difficult to find and the existing pieces had no flavor.
*Cecina de Le√≥n, watermelon and pepper pil-pil. Delicious dish, although personally there is too much sauce.
*Basque cheesecake. Disappointing. Cold and compact, with hardly any flavor. Nothing melty (it was reminiscent of the typical Philadelphia cheesecake).
Modern decoration, with a bar area, high tables and low tables. Very shabby that you have to go to the bathrooms in the hall of the building.
The staff, not all of whom speak Spanish, were very friendly, attentive at all times and had a nice detail at the end with the cake.
It is not bad as a first contact with our food for those who do not know it (or so that Spaniards who live in Abu Dhabi can have a little corner of Spain), but for those of us who know it and are aware of its richness, it is very scarce.

The Fried Chicken Bao was also very flavorful, with crispy chicken that had a nice kick of spice. The Fried Shrimps were cooked to perfection, with a crispy exterior and tender, juicy shrimp inside.

#NadzOnTheGo: MAMAFRI.
Had an exclusive invite to the Grand Opening and Abu Dhabi debut of the iconic, South-East Asian fusion restaurant!
Drop everything and head out here coz you are so gonna @lovemamafri !! Absolutely unique flavours, tastes and aromas of Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia and beyond.
A family business founded by two Emirati cousins, pronounced ‚Äòmah-muh-frayh', is going to be the BEST flavors of Southeast Asian cooking that you will ever put in your mouth ‚Äì I guarantee you that!
Loved the cosy, minimalistic interior with gorgeous contemporary design. There‚Äôs a bar and open kitchen area, where you get a peek at how the delicious food is made. The vibe is just superb with a unique playlist filling up the air and dim-lit ambiance with table lamps. We tried:
Appetizers:
Tempura Corn Fritters
Crispy Beef
Chicken Toast Bites
Mama Salad
Mains:
Mama‚Äôs Special Rise
Mie Goreng
Malaysian Curry
Dessert:
Coco Cloud
Drinks:
Lychee Rose Lemonade
Every single dish & drink for me was 10/10 - YOU SIMPLY HAVE TO TRY IT RIGHT AWAY!
Located in Sheikha Fatima Park in Abu Dhabi from 1pm to 12am on weekdays and 1pm to 1am on weekends.

Alongside this delightful specialty, they offer a variety of other shawarmas, including beef and chicken, all served with a range of delectable bread options.
What sets this restaurant apart is the live cooking experience. Watching the skilled chefs prepare the food right in front of you adds an extra touch of excitement. And let me tell you, the food is simply divine. Every dish I tried was bursting with flavor and cooked to perfection.
In addition to their remarkable shawarma selection, they also offer an array of other dishes to satisfy every craving. From pizzas and Manakeesh to burgers, sandwiches, chicken and beef steaks, and mouthwatering main courses like Chicken Fajita and Creamy Chicken served with potato balls in white sauce, their menu is a culinary delight.
To complement the delicious food, the restaurant also offers an extensive range of drinks and fresh juices. Whether you're in the mood for a refreshing beverage or a nutritious fruit juice, they have you covered.
In summary, I highly recommend this new restaurant for anyone seeking an authentic Arabic cuisine experience.

I come before couple of days
I also have a restaurant
I'm from Spain to a great country that has everything you need at a very low cost
it's the first time that I write about my experience with a restaurant.
it's my first time in an Arab country.
It's the first time that I eat Arabic food.
Everything was great experience wise.  I was very impressed with the desserts they serve ...and the food is really amazing and absolutely wonderful.
But all this was not done and will not be done except through this young man (Mahmoud).
He really is a treasure for this restaurant, he told me the best food and explained everything I wanted, since I have no experience with Arabic food, but thanks to him, he made the experience more than wonderful.
you will be falls in love with him from the first time ... the way treats you ... He has a lot of experience and a great degree professionalism when he talking  .. And above at all, he's extremely handsome and very funny to the extreme. made me unable to laugh excessively.  What a lovely person.  I have seen this in his dealings with some clients Others at adjacent tables.
Meet the aspirations and vocation of his work.
If i could take him there with me (I mean Spain of course)
I will put him in charge of the restaurant and I will teach him the language because he really told me that he loves the Spanish language.
I will definitely try and work to bring it.  It will be useful for me.  You will love the place very much.

We mainly struggled with service, orders were slow and there weren't enough staff based on the size of the restaurant.
We ordered a number of flat breads (mixed cheese, zaatar and mushroom &cheese) very nice dough and ingredients with a nice crust.
Additionally we ordered tabouleh , hummos and falafel. Hummos was good, tabouleh was moderate and the falafel was small, over priced and wasn't well done interns of taste and texture.
Final order was hummos fatte which was really bad and tasteless. It needs to be changed to match the quality of the rest of the items.
They took long time to get the drinks which were basically khameer tea and karak tea. Karak tea had nothing to do with the standard karak tea. It was simply tea and milk without any other flavours. Khameer tea was decent but had a slightly strong cinnamon taste.
They need to work on their service and quality of food to match the location. Even the menu was filled with spelling mistakes just like my review üòÇ.
Some fixes and tweaks and it would be one of the best middle Eastern dining spots in the capital. Would give it another chance next time. Hope to see and improvement in the food menu.",3.0,a year ago,"5db456c45cb4287ebffcfd396f1ca7,845d2bbee5b4758eea2fc186629b30,fc2cfe714f2ff99fa2f010ba04a862"

I decided to try Talea Restaurant for the first time . The menu is very limited but I didn‚Äôt mind because I just wanted to try their pizza. My favorite is the Divola pizza because of the spice pork salami. They served the salami on the side because of religious cooking etiquette and I didn‚Äôt know prior to ordering. Salami should be cooked on the pizza to enhance the flavor of the pizza. The pizza was good but the salami tasted bland uncooked. I understand why prosciutto ham and cured beef ham  are not cooked on the pizza because of the delicate texture and quality should be served raw. Throughout Italy and Sicily  and entire pizza world , I‚Äôve never eaten raw salami on pizza. So, it‚Äôs just a different experience and don‚Äôt recommend it to other customers.
The staff is very friendly and professional. The wine list is extremely extensive and  expensive focused on Italian wines. I only drank the wine by the glass, since I was alone. The wine by the glass is basically low budget and low quality. There are much better budget wines available that can be served but maybe unavailable in UAE. The numerous high quality bottle wines on menu are super expensive.

We ordered chicken lolly pop tossed in fresh schezwan sauce, gobi tawa fry, Dal tadka, jeera rice, Alfredo pasta, masala chaas and passion fruit ice tea.
The food was very tasty and the portion size is big.
Binoy was very courteous to take care of our food requirements.
The manager also personally ensured that we were comfortable with the food quality.
One downside is the parking limitation at the restaurant which is difficult to get during day time and also cannot park after 9pm if you go for dinner as it is a residence parking area.
One suggestion would be to park in the big parking lot on the main corniche road and walk to the restaurant which could take 5 minutes.
Another thing is that the restaurant is in the interior and not visible from the main road.",4.0,2 years ago,"29cf8c62b5fdd547bb14f578a17e30,d3153b3e0a57d17e481bdffb3af4d9,e3d46a605a9d447dbf7a46c00554a2,9e4fddc1bed946784258bfa55545f0,7a2cf3090e6d784480bae09db6dbac,d34ae3350d20c3f4cad8ea6cb91995,4ce6cc96f7141570c64cbc40d6bf69,c6b25cbea2b18f64a2262e308ac435,7b280a77251d3db36be47e6e50d86a,5875333f474129a8cd174c12daa253,1814de3ec189f3b77aa66b8e84243a,f718300d35cf4a24a89b054a4dfa7d,fa3f1abfe58028f742644e4dd79a5c,d3ea7a6c87e76482db0d635a198235,b9a9c93bb88886bdb4cb612c3a6af7,eece1f87135dba72f0494f96195cfd,8a6ecbff4438df9f14c7117d941256,7ddc5bd57cffde6dc83ed8b1de4cfc,8ba8906c8e0d67b680b24cab898b81,fc16494958f539a25f629488386729,e98aac1afebdbd9c4095ea99852b18,840724249c5eb8a96603584f1d82c3,d5c06daee42c9379ea4ead0704a4d9,88072cb8a84c72c5f02b0486fc5374,999cf02daa931c216c3192143cc9b8"

Coming towards cleanliness..the table wasnt clean..it was dusty.. food particles were all over the floor.. the cleaning guy just dusts the food off the table and leaves it on the floor??!!
Price wise.. 2 expensive..really guys you got to review your prices again.. i mean mie goreng for nearly 70dhs??!! And you fill it with soy sauce..its not edible at All

Went for the wings and boneless combo. They offer the sauce/seasoning on the side (in a pot) or on the chicken.
The garlic parmesan tastes like a Pizza Hut garlic pizza bread. The chipotle bbq seasoning is a salt not a sauce. The medium buffalo has no heat.
The wings were a bit small. The bites were a bit dry. I‚Äôd probably go mango habanero, hot, bbq or teriyaki for sauces, but not in a rush to return for them.

We received extremely rough service and impolite manner from a waiter named Matteo. This included carelessly spilling water when serving to each member of the family and presenting menus across our heads. He continued to mock my nephew, raising his voice at him in an aggressive manner. Then repeatedly asked ‚ÄúAll good?‚Äù in a condescending tone.
My wife and I have been regular customers of The Mandarin Oriental Bangkok since 1980, The Oriental Bangkok was the name at that time. I did immediately order him to leave our area and asked for The Restaurant Manager, Mr Lorenzo, to complain. It was lucky to see Mr Lorenzo, who understands the meaning of ‚Äúhappiness of family ‚Äú, taking charge of our table quickly. If it wasn‚Äôt for Mr Lorenzo, our family might have had a terrible dinner at TALEA, The Mandarin Oriental. He went the extra mile, took responsibility and is a great, and responsive manager. I strongly ask the administrative to reconsider my note here. Also being a long time customer, I shall pass this to The Mandarin Oriental Bangkok.",1.0,a year ago,"6da67362319ca74536f53693b40da8,6017409906e3dbc9a2658fdb4b3260"
