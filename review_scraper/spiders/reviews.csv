I had heard so much hype about B Laban's desserts that I couldn't resist trying them myself. Yesterday, I visited and sampled their mango and chocolate desserts, both of which were simply amazing and utterly delicious.
B Laban specializes in authentic Egyptian desserts, making it a unique find in the dessert scene. The ambience of the place was lively and inviting, perfectly complemented by great service. The staff were exceptionally polite and attentive, adding to the overall positive experience.
The atmosphere here is full of life, with vibrant music and a bustling crowd creating a fantastic vibe. It's clear why there's so much hype around B Laban‚Äîit's a must-visit spot for dessert lovers looking for something different and delightful.

B Laban Abu Dhabi,"24.4746835,54.376186",EARL UNLIMITED,"The food here is fantastic! Everything I tried was delicious, well-prepared, and very flavorful. (Anything with pistacios i like best) I would definitely recommend the food to anyone looking for a tasty meal.
However, my experience was brought down a bit by the long wait times. There was a long line for ordering, and then another line for receiving my food that seemed a bit disorganized. (No proper queue) If the staff could improve the ordering and pick-up process, it would make the whole experience much smoother.
Tables are kept unclean.. no proper tissue..
I was also a little put off by the staff member who asked me to leave a review. While I appreciate them wanting feedback, it felt pushy to insist on a 5-star rating. Honest reviews are important, so I wanted to share my full experience, both the good and the not-so-good.
Overall, the delicious food makes this place worth a visit, but be prepared for a wait and arabic menu. Hopefully, they can streamline their ordering process in the future.

I once visited this place at 2:45 am hoping I could get my hands on something but the crowd was so much that I had to return with a heavy heart.
I finally placed my order through noon and wanted to try 3 dishes - lotus and pista qushori, caramel tresleche and mango milk cake.
( They have different names on the menu but I have given the names I understood)
They were outstanding and I was mind blown with the softness of the cake and I was wanting more.
You can keep these dishes in your fridge for up to 2 days and consume them. One dish will be enough for up to 3 people as it's very heavy and filling.

B Laban Abu Dhabi,"24.4746835,54.376186",Nithin Pushpakumar,"Overpriced. Not worth the money or the hype.
The quality of materials used is questionable for the price they offer them. When premium prices are being demanded, you owe the customer to provide better a much quality.
Even the quantity of sauces, condiments, toppings are not uniform with each order. There is no consistency for the quantity or the quality.
The place itself is also ill managed. The guys at the counter doesn't speak any language other than Arabic. They were transferring materials from a van into the refrigerators and one of the labors almost hit my head while transferring the trays.
I have tried from the place a total of three times now and all three times, it was a bad experience. Not going back again.

B Laban Abu Dhabi,"24.4746835,54.376186",Mehlika Fathima,"The hype is real!! We had tried desserts from here twice straight in a week. It's super crowded on weekends especially post evenings. You will have to stand long queues to make an order and wait further for the dessert. Best part is it's all super cheap. For the price, they serve you with generous amount of nuts and sauce. The best was fried ice cream which comes with chocolate and pistachio sauces. Tried koshari which came in lotus and pistachio flavour. It was subtle and not overly sweet. Also tried mango milk cake. That wasn't great. But their pistachio milk cake is really good. Also tried waffles and couple of other desserts. All their Icecreams were great. You get two scoops for 15/. It's definitely worth a try. But too much of waiting and effort!!

The tomato sauce was spoiled, so I requested to give another.
In summer some of the food items get spoiled due to hot temperature, precaution should be taken while storing sauces and yoghurt to avoid uncomfortable situation.

This popular Lebanese restaurant was a delightful discovery. We tried the Mushroom with Meat, Falafel Plate, and Soft Hummus, all for just 57 AED. üòã
The place was buzzing with patrons, and it's no wonder! It took a bit to get a table, but the flavorful, freshly served food was absolutely worth the wait. Their salads and bread are complimentary and unlimited - a delightful bonus!
While the ambiance may be described as average, the real star here is the food. It satisfies your cravings to the max, and the prices are incredibly reasonable. A win-win for your taste buds and your wallet.

Looking for the best shawarma and reading all the reviews, everyone else says this is the best place.
Absolutely right! This was one of the best shawarma I‚Äôve had in Abu Dhabi.
What makes this shawarma so good?
The flatbread is freshly baked. The chicken was soft and juicy. The right amount of sauce and fries. It‚Äôs not wrapped in a kubz, instead it‚Äôs more like a pita bread. The softness of the bread with the spicy sauce makes this the best shawarma ever üëçüèΩ

I'm just posting this to add credibility to the review. What I ordered delivered this time was a menu called Liver meal. The thing on the right that looks like a bunch of wet pillowcases is like a chapatti, but it's stretchy and thin like pastry. The middle is the main one. It's seasoned with seasoned vegetables and stir-fried. This is really cool... this. If you go to High Spirits, they sell soju, but since it's Chotu, you have to buy vodka. Also, there is crushed tomato juice below, so it goes well with it. Vegetables are really trash. It would be a waste to express it any other way. I don't think they have the concept of 'fresh'. If you pour green paint on dried cardboard and mix it with vegetables, the owner of this restaurant will have no choice but to chew it all up.
