Bu Tafish,"24.451642,54.3341759",EARL UNLIMITED,101834365549089978061,78,"This restaurant impressed me with its first impression! The place is clean, spacious, and beautifully decorated - perfect for capturing stunning photos. The tables and chairs look expensive and stylish, adding to the overall luxurious feel.
The service was excellent!  (I forgot the staff name,He was friendly and attentive)  However, there was a bit of a language barrier as the staff didn't speak much English. Thankfully, we had an Arabic friend with us who helped bridge the gap.  (the restaurant offers menus in english but you need to scan a code to acces their menu)
We ordered a seafood bucket, one with chili flavor and one with saffron. The overflowing sauce was delicious, and the saffron flavor was particularly good.  The shrimp were large and juicy, a definite highlight.  However, some of the seafood was a bit disappointing. The mussels were soggy and almost dissolved, and the lobster meat was tough and didn't taste quite fresh.  The crab meat was also inconsistent - some pieces were nicely cooked and juicy, while others were mushy.
Overall, the ambiance and service were top-notch, and the food had its high points.  However, the inconsistency with the seafood quality brought the rating down a notch.  A minor point, but the water was also quite expensive.  They did accept coupons we found on Instagram, which was a nice perk.  There's also free valet parking, which is a big plus.  I'd recommend this restaurant if you want instagramable shots, but keep in mind the potential for some variability in the seafood freshness.

Its menu features exquisite Indian fare and extraordinary drinks, as well as a soothing ambiance filled with Indian soft musicüé∂üéºüéµ
These are some of the items we tasted:
The Unmissable: Chaat Platter. This has everything that a Street Foodie Loves To Dig Intoüòãüòã Samosa, Pani Puri, Karkare Palak Chaat, Tamarind Potato, Dahi Bhalla üòãüòãüòã
We also tried the mixed kebab platter which was another stellar dish and worth a try if you are a kebab lover. All the meats were tender and juicy. There is also a vegetarian version of this.
As there are so many options, we decided to order Ghee Roast Chicken with Chettinad sauce and Dab Moilee curry. It had a perfect amount of spiciness and thickening in the gravy, just how we like it!
I would like to thank the staff for selecting the right dishes for us.
.
Also, mutton biryani is definitely worth trying. There was nothing short of amazing about it. Everything was perfect - the taste, the texture of the rice, the fragrance, the succulent meat, and the quantity. This dish definitely deserves a 10/10.
You should try Falooda if you have a sweet tooth.
Overall, This restaurant is the perfect place for fine dining that goes above and beyond the ordinary.T here's no doubt you'll enjoy the bright and jovial ambiance.

Being in Nation Tower this restaurant has lined up the Menu worth attracting the local and Arab patrons. Tastes and spices have also been adjusted accordingly in the predominant Indian dishes.
Though the vegetarian spread is limited but we weren‚Äôt disappointed. Best was the Grilled Watermelon Ricotta Cheese Salad. Ummm‚Ä¶ the salad was bursting with myriad of flavors. Sweet watermelon, salty cheese, sharp n pungent rocket leaves, juicy strawberry, apples, seeds and pomegranates and tangy dressing. Loved it‚Ä¶.
In the main-course we had ordered jackfruit curry (kathal) n daal makhani. Jackfruit preparation was good and distinct jackfruit taste was relishable amidst the not so spicy curry. The coating of jackfruit though was thicker. The coating done while frying should be delicate and thin. Daal Makhani was quite good and upto the Peppermill standard.
We reached the restaurant at 10:30 pm and was completely empty and nearing the closing time. Shameem seated us with full courtesy and waited on us patiently beyond the closing hours. Full marks to him. He had complete knowledge of the dishes featured in the menu and answered all my detailed queries about the ingredients etc to my satisfaction. In many of the restaurants the involvement of serving staff is missing.
Another item which caught my eye was Ghongura Tandoori Paneer but have left it for next time.

The Service: Good service. What you would expect from a restaurant like this.
The Atmosphere: Great interior design and lovely seating area. However, loud music is blasting through the speakers. Sometimes the music is calm and goes well with the vibe of the place, and other times the music is loud, weird selection of music.
Overall, I would give this restaurant a higher review if not for the pricing. A pricing scheme that makes it seem like a 5 star restaurant but doesn‚Äôt quite justify it with the food, service, and atmosphere.

The ambience was cozy but a little too bare for my liking. The female staff took our orders and she even wrote it in a paper and still got it wrong! Unbelievable! I did not order a matcha latte.. the word ‚Äúmatcha‚Äù has not even come up in any of our interactions, so I never knew why they got it wrong. I did not return the wrong drink because I thought that the barista took an effort in making it and I don‚Äôt wanna waste his effort.. good thing that I drink matcha, unlike my companion who was with me. Second thing that irked me (or us) was the very slow service. Our basic orders came too late for it to be reasonable, 30mins or more for a cheese sandwich, 2 toasts, eggs, beans, and sausages? C‚Äômon. There was no other customer but us in that restaurant at that particular time and even during the whole time we spent there. When the food arrived, no special plating ‚Äî nothing special actually, and yet it took too long. This female server was also not attentive. I asked her for Tabasco, she went into their pantry and came with nothing. She proceeded to tell me that they only have Sriracha and so I said that I will have it. She went back to their pantry and came with nothing and completely forgot about our request, didn‚Äôt even come back to the table. We ate our breakfast around 30minutes and the entire time there was no visible staff inside the restaurant that we can call for anything we need. Their staff seriously needs customer service lessons.

We had millet beetroot salad, burrata salad, sweet and sour brisket, sirloin steak, grilled corn fed chicken and truffle pumpkin risotto.
The grilled corn fed chicken included the skin and bones so it wasn‚Äôt super easy to eat, and the taste was average. The truffle pumpkin risotto was tasty if you like the taste of truffles! The sirloin steak was overcooked as we asked for medium well done but got it well done.
For the dessert, we had the cheesecake which was extremely fresh and tasty and the triple chocolate brownie which was a little average. All the coffee drinks we ordered weren‚Äôt great (mocha, latte, flat white) but the only nice drink was the dialogue latte.

It is because of the service and incident that has occurred to me yesterday.
We have decided to have a quick bite at this Libanese restaurant after we have visited the hotel with a visitor.
We have arrived to the restaurant and the lady from Philippines at the entrance said hello sir, table for 3.. Do you have a reservation?
Well, please note that it was 4pm and the restaurant is huge and literally empty so I made a innocent joke saying hmm I dont think we need a reservation.. It is empty or are you  expecting many ppl at 4 pm? With a smile.. She replied with an arrogance I rarely see in Dubai by saying well sir to dine at the hotel you have to have a reservation and even at the door of the hotel sometimes they wont let you in if you dont have a reservation.. I have stopped her and said.. Dont give me false informations and you shouldn't argue with your  only client and with any client unless the words you are saying are at least relevant or true!
For those who never visited the hotel.. Take note that the hotel is open to all as long as you wear something nicely casual ( no shorts, tanks and flipflops) thats allllll... And it always has been this way even when I last visited for a drink 3 years ago!
I lookedat  her and said thats not true.. And she looked at me and said with a sarcastic smile.. Okkk its not.
I let go because I have spent a nice day and its worthless to make her day miserable as I was right!
I then knew that the hotel is undergoing a management shift and shall be under Mandarin Oriental soon.. GOOD because knowing the MO hotels.. A person with her attitude and her delusional facts will not DO!
The food is good snd and the rest of the team were ok although they seemed like they are doing as charity!
Very expensive for a Libanese and for that place!

And asked our dad to come because we love their food it was his first time. Last week on 17/2 we went to Abu Dhabi branch and it was awful experience definitely not visiting again!! And the staff and the manager are so bad don't know how to solve problems only making it worse.
We faced two problems, and both waitresses had an attitude!
First, they were serving the appetizers and main courses together! We haven‚Äôt finish the salad and the noodles were on the table already! They kept filling the table with plates and we were five and their tables are small so we were literally eating fast so other plates could fit in!!
We asked them to hold the other plates and both waitresses said ‚Äúthe food will come cold, and it‚Äôs not our problem if it tasted bad‚Äù The attitude!!! We called the manager and she took care of it.
Second, we paid and left and the waitress were running after us and said that the payment didn‚Äôt work we checked with the bank and it debited! She asked us to go back to the restaurant and we did. We asked them how come and it debited from our side, she didn‚Äôt explain a thing she said ‚Äúit okay it happened before we need you to pay again‚Äù !!! The manager comes to explain and she was making a scene!! Didn‚Äôt solve it made it worse and they were literally asking us to pay again! And they said ‚Äúthat this problem happened before 10 times at least with the machine you paid with‚Äù WHAT!!!! So you know the problem with the machine and still let us pay with it, they didn‚Äôt solve it my dad solve their own problem.
Even their customer service is bad i have been in contact with them in instagram since we left the restaurant and they said will updated me which they haven‚Äôt and asked for my contact number and that‚Äôs all and haven‚Äôt heard from them!

The cafe has a tranquil vibe  the interior is very soothing. They have very high ceilings, a lot of natural daylight coming in, and earthy coloured interior and decorations. A great place to sit with friends to have a coffee. Or to sit and work. I ordered the Iced Matcha Latte, which is served with Almond Milk and Vanilla. The waitress was very proactive by informing me in advance about the vanilla in the Iced Matcha Latte, as it made the drink sweeter than a regular matcha, which can have a bitter taste, but I didnt find the vanilla overpowering.  It was well balanced. We also tried the Iced Nitro Tea, which was something I never had before. The Nitro Tea tasted refreshing and with the carbonation it had a different taste and sensation that a regular Iced Tea.
We also tried the Cheesecake, which was delicious by the way! It was in a good portion size. The flavours where very well balanced. The lemon flavour wasn't to sour not sweet. The caramel, small meringues and Berry compote created a nice flavour. We finished the Cheesecake very fast.
Besides the vibe, good food, and good service, I really liked that they have a wide variety of beverages. So there is plenty of different options that can suit anyone's taste. So if you aren't in the mood for coffee, there are teas, mocktails and juices, seltzer and more to choose from.

Corniche Street, Abu Dhabi.
We visited for family lunch.
It was empty, and having only another occupied table with couple of guests.
Staff are not welcoming neither professional as expected.
They are not attentive and not friendly at all.
Even the restaurant was empty, it was hard to get attention from any waiter or staff.
We had to look for a waiter and call for assistance anytime we need anything or we have any request.
No table visits was conducted, and we barely got attention from waiters.
Ordered items presentation was very good, but no appetizing.
We were disappointed by the quality and the taste was below expectations for such a fine dine levantine restaurant.
Kebbeh nayyeh was far away from the expectationst.
Soujouk with molasses was tasteless and the mix of taste was not matching with molasses.
Fatteh was below expectations and didn't taste good, just the makdous was ok, but the mix was awfully bad and extremely salty.
We had to ask many times for bread and when we asked it was delivered late.
Grilled chicken was good, some parts were over grilled was hard to chew for the kids.
Fries were good.
Dynamite shrimps had appearance and taste.
Most of the items tasted below expectations, and we didn't continue all the dishes.
Service is slow and bad.
Prices are fair but a total waste for such service and taste.
Atmosphere was good, it is very well decorated.
Unused table were not clean, and all of them were having mugs and water bottle marks on them and needed cleaning.
Outdoor sitting area need maintenance, but it seems nice to sit out in the evening.
Most probably won't return the visit.
Had a small issue and the staff and supervisor on duty handled it very unprofessionally.
Hope to give intensive training for the staff in terms of basic hospitality and communication skills and manners especially for the supervisor that was in duty during the time if visit.
Would give half a star comparing with the food and service provided by the Levantine and  Lebanese Restaurant just next to it on Corniche road.",1.0,11 months ago,"257c2b4723b95293f2acb8df9ea810,0cdb6e1198eddd67a9195a5ba2b3d4,bd60974cb396db1795a2ca1da16335,6d47381e1d071ccdef2099036083c7,f63cf977da1b44feea62a861cf8d40,9f540bef9c313986a0961f530910f6,8c30c55ed378469daadca53a1c2a89,553921757cb44c2b5d59838a953326,4a9316622af722ee69aade2c5a53ca,6129c1ddc1c6639ce1ef4018fc8181,a3c89457d6e988560a0b2751670425,c78ae0f36a6d3bc70d584527cb0f1d,9aec5e2e4fc766388723cf2fefbbf4,576f544b86ec3df9083c0c6119902b,3ee151b00db2d4857115da9e05ca80,2fdb10188e927321b0cd3970955c77,fa6d5f8a5b16cc13dd84eca395ab9a,a99fca7cf43328b363e1292a3519b6,6fcf89171e668bb31359ddc7965159,7a37eb094139bf0e446e8a44a4c16e,d715934f46f3089fe0c886249db9a6,43f731b5cb8eb485f727c43ed5e26f,5f8067857de96cc5983821cf2817f0,a7ae85de6beb284d169e750e4ea3c2,3516a3fc18ba00617bf0c6e3e558d5"

We ordered a rose lychee lemonade and it was really good! Then we have started with an appetizer, crispy beef. It was alright as a start. You could easily taste the burnt oil even with the heat hiding it well and definitely needed the seseme to pop more. Then we had two main dishes, the first was a crispy chicken ramen. Which was awful. You are better off with a Wagamama Ramen or a storebought brand. And we also had a much better Malaysian Curry, it still was off as the spices were hidden by the heat and the coconut. And finally, we had the coco cloud for dessert which was good.

(Out of context, but god bless the waiting list resto guru thing, not only does it tell you which number you are in the waiting list, but it tells you how long it would take! After we put our name on the waiting list, you get a message with the link and you just keep tracking the time which is pretty useful). Moving on, I have heard so many people talk about how good the restaurant is, I have been dying to try it. I was actually pretty disappointed when entering the restaurant cause I didn‚Äôt expect it be this small! For such a great location, I would have expected it to be way bigger (it‚Äôs very cramped), but that obviously affect how good it is. The interior is stunning - simple, modern, and beautiful. We ordered their crispy beef, which me and my friend absolutely loved - personally I didn‚Äôt like the beef alone but with the mashed potato, I wouldn‚Äôt mind eating 10 of it! However, my other didn‚Äôt really like it, she thought it was too saucy. We also ordered their fried rice and it was super yummy. We also had their chicken tonkatsu - it was crispy and really good + their mi goreng (noodles) which I personally didn‚Äôt like but my friends really liked it. For drinks, my friend had their lychee rose lemonade - it was fizzy but she liked it. I had their strawberry mojito which was good. There were a lot of comments about how it‚Äôs overrated but honestly I don‚Äôt see it as overrated, it was different + genuinely really good and we would definitely go back to try their other things. The staff were super nice, they would come occasionally and ask if things were good and all that.

The ambiance is small and cozy, with dark decorations and soft lights, very pleasant. It may be difficult to read and appreciate the food, though. The music level, unfortunately, was a bit on the high side, when I came, and it was difficult to have a conversation.
The place is very popular with local youth, which makes it gets very crowded and quickly full. I am not sure whether distancing is fully implemented but the number of tables is maybe ten in total.
We had some sashimi, some nilgiri, two types of maki rolls, two types of yakitori skewers, a salad and two different types of noodles.
Sashimi selection was very limited (only salmon was available that night) and of average quality. So went for the nilgiri and maki, sushi rice was nice.
The skewers were interesting, although maybe the seasoning with sauces and seeds a bit overwhelming the taste of beef and chicken, but globally good.
Both noodles were excessively sweet. The preparation is eccentric and fashionable, with the noodles coming served aside a half coconut on the plate, which makes good IG photo opportunities. However, the level of sweetness, which may suggest maybe a Filipino cook is behind this dish(?), doesn't make justice to those dishes.
The total bill was around 600 AED.
The experience was globally ok, but I am not sure if I will come back.

*Bread with tomato. Delicious, toasted, but very little tomato and oil.
*Fat olives stuffed with orange. Original. The sweet orange offsets the vinegary touch of the olives.
*Omelette. We asked for it very rare, we insisted on it, and it arrived like a block, with the outside super caked. Inside, the few potatoes were looser, but everything was tremendously salty.
*Russian salad with belly. Awful. The belly was dry, not at all oily, and the salad was basically mayonnaise, the potatoes were difficult to find and the existing pieces had no flavor.
*Cecina de Le√≥n, watermelon and pepper pil-pil. Delicious dish, although personally there is too much sauce.
*Basque cheesecake. Disappointing. Cold and compact, with hardly any flavor. Nothing melty (it was reminiscent of the typical Philadelphia cheesecake).
Modern decoration, with a bar area, high tables and low tables. Very shabby that you have to go to the bathrooms in the hall of the building.
The staff, not all of whom speak Spanish, were very friendly, attentive at all times and had a nice detail at the end with the cake.
It is not bad as a first contact with our food for those who do not know it (or so that Spaniards who live in Abu Dhabi can have a little corner of Spain), but for those of us who know it and are aware of its richness, it is very scarce. Ignoring any pork dish, we miss some spoon dish, more vegetables/legumes, Galician meat, octopus, salmorejo/gazpacho, some squid, bravas...

Had an exclusive invite to the Grand Opening and Abu Dhabi debut of the iconic, South-East Asian fusion restaurant!
Drop everything and head out here coz you are so gonna @lovemamafri !! Absolutely unique flavours, tastes and aromas of Korea, Malaysia, Indonesia and beyond.
A family business founded by two Emirati cousins, pronounced ‚Äòmah-muh-frayh', is going to be the BEST flavors of Southeast Asian cooking that you will ever put in your mouth ‚Äì I guarantee you that!
Loved the cosy, minimalistic interior with gorgeous contemporary design. There‚Äôs a bar and open kitchen area, where you get a peek at how the delicious food is made. The vibe is just superb with a unique playlist filling up the air and dim-lit ambiance with table lamps. We tried:
Appetizers:
Tempura Corn Fritters
Crispy Beef
Chicken Toast Bites
Mama Salad
Mains:
Mama‚Äôs Special Rise
Mie Goreng
Malaysian Curry
Dessert:
Coco Cloud
Drinks:
Lychee Rose Lemonade
Every single dish & drink for me was 10/10 - YOU SIMPLY HAVE TO TRY IT RIGHT AWAY!
Located in Sheikha Fatima Park in Abu Dhabi from 1pm to 12am on weekdays and 1pm to 1am on weekends.

Service is excellent! Staff member Khalid was very welcoming, attended to our table regularly to check on us, and he took a suggestion from us in a very professional manner.
Food was very good. We ordered Mushroom and Chestnut Soup, which I think will become their signature if they really make the chestnut more present in the soup (I suggested they cut the chestnuts into larger pieces and add more of it to the soup cuz it was delicious). The Rocka and Mozzarella Balls Salad was also good especially with the crunch of the cheese balls and the hazelnuts, if they add walnuts on top it will take the dish to another level I think. Hummus with Kebbeh dish was my favourite, I loved the combination. Now the Mixed Grills dish was disappointing for me due to the quality of the meat. Kabab was greasy and the meat was chewy, also bulgur was lemony. This dish is overpriced (89dhs) given the quantity and the meat quality. Overall, it was a lovely experience and I will definitely come back to try other menu items.

What sets this restaurant apart is the live cooking experience. Watching the skilled chefs prepare the food right in front of you adds an extra touch of excitement. And let me tell you, the food is simply divine. Every dish I tried was bursting with flavor and cooked to perfection.
In addition to their remarkable shawarma selection, they also offer an array of other dishes to satisfy every craving. From pizzas and Manakeesh to burgers, sandwiches, chicken and beef steaks, and mouthwatering main courses like Chicken Fajita and Creamy Chicken served with potato balls in white sauce, their menu is a culinary delight.
To complement the delicious food, the restaurant also offers an extensive range of drinks and fresh juices. Whether you're in the mood for a refreshing beverage or a nutritious fruit juice, they have you covered.
In summary, I highly recommend this new restaurant for anyone seeking an authentic Arabic cuisine experience.

I come before couple of days
I also have a restaurant
I'm from Spain to a great country that has everything you need at a very low cost
it's the first time that I write about my experience with a restaurant.
it's my first time in an Arab country.
It's the first time that I eat Arabic food.
Everything was great experience wise.  I was very impressed with the desserts they serve ...and the food is really amazing and absolutely wonderful.
But all this was not done and will not be done except through this young man (Mahmoud).
He really is a treasure for this restaurant, he told me the best food and explained everything I wanted, since I have no experience with Arabic food, but thanks to him, he made the experience more than wonderful.
you will be falls in love with him from the first time ... the way treats you ... He has a lot of experience and a great degree professionalism when he talking  .. And above at all, he's extremely handsome and very funny to the extreme. made me unable to laugh excessively.  What a lovely person.  I have seen this in his dealings with some clients Others at adjacent tables.
Meet the aspirations and vocation of his work.
If i could take him there with me (I mean Spain of course)
I will put him in charge of the restaurant and I will teach him the language because he really told me that he loves the Spanish language.
I will definitely try and work to bring it.  It will be useful for me.  You will love the place very much.

We mainly struggled with service, orders were slow and there weren't enough staff based on the size of the restaurant.
We ordered a number of flat breads (mixed cheese, zaatar and mushroom &cheese) very nice dough and ingredients with a nice crust.
Additionally we ordered tabouleh , hummos and falafel. Hummos was good, tabouleh was moderate and the falafel was small, over priced and wasn't well done interns of taste and texture.
Final order was hummos fatte which was really bad and tasteless. It needs to be changed to match the quality of the rest of the items.
They took long time to get the drinks which were basically khameer tea and karak tea. Karak tea had nothing to do with the standard karak tea. It was simply tea and milk without any other flavours. Khameer tea was decent but had a slightly strong cinnamon taste.
They need to work on their service and quality of food to match the location. Even the menu was filled with spelling mistakes just like my review üòÇ.

I decided to try Talea Restaurant for the first time . The menu is very limited but I didn‚Äôt mind because I just wanted to try their pizza. My favorite is the Divola pizza because of the spice pork salami. They served the salami on the side because of religious cooking etiquette and I didn‚Äôt know prior to ordering. Salami should be cooked on the pizza to enhance the flavor of the pizza. The pizza was good but the salami tasted bland uncooked. I understand why prosciutto ham and cured beef ham  are not cooked on the pizza because of the delicate texture and quality should be served raw. Throughout Italy and Sicily  and entire pizza world , I‚Äôve never eaten raw salami on pizza. So, it‚Äôs just a different experience and don‚Äôt recommend it to other customers.
The staff is very friendly and professional. The wine list is extremely extensive and  expensive focused on Italian wines. I only drank the wine by the glass, since I was alone. The wine by the glass is basically low budget and low quality. There are much better budget wines available that can be served but maybe unavailable in UAE. The numerous high quality bottle wines on menu are super expensive.

Cost: It was a little high in cost. Average per person cost will be AED 50.

The ambience is good with spacious sitting arrangement and is well lit with bright lights.
The menu caters to Indian food including chaat items, starters, curries, platters in veg as well as chicken, mutton and fish.
We ordered chicken lolly pop tossed in fresh schezwan sauce, gobi tawa fry, Dal tadka, jeera rice, Alfredo pasta, masala chaas and passion fruit ice tea.
The food was very tasty and the portion size is big.
Binoy was very courteous to take care of our food requirements.
The manager also personally ensured that we were comfortable with the food quality.
One downside is the parking limitation at the restaurant which is difficult to get during day time and also cannot park after 9pm if you go for dinner as it is a residence parking area.
One suggestion would be to park in the big parking lot on the main corniche road and walk to the restaurant which could take 5 minutes.

This included carelessly spilling water when serving to each member of the family and presenting menus across our heads. He continued to mock my nephew, raising his voice at him in an aggressive manner. Then repeatedly asked ‚ÄúAll good?‚Äù in a condescending tone.
My wife and I have been regular customers of The Mandarin Oriental Bangkok since 1980, The Oriental Bangkok was the name at that time. I did immediately order him to leave our area and asked for The Restaurant Manager, Mr Lorenzo, to complain. It was lucky to see Mr Lorenzo, who understands the meaning of ‚Äúhappiness of family ‚Äú, taking charge of our table quickly. If it wasn‚Äôt for Mr Lorenzo, our family might have had a terrible dinner at TALEA, The Mandarin Oriental. He went the extra mile, took responsibility and is a great, and responsive manager.

Went for the wings and boneless combo. They offer the sauce/seasoning on the side (in a pot) or on the chicken.
The garlic parmesan tastes like a Pizza Hut garlic pizza bread. The chipotle bbq seasoning is a salt not a sauce. The medium buffalo has no heat.
The wings were a bit small. The bites were a bit dry. I‚Äôd probably go mango habanero, hot, bbq or teriyaki for sauces, but not in a rush to return for them.

the moment you enter, you can tell the vibes are amazing. they have a few different elements to showcase the old and new, from portaits of artists to old tvs - they have some cool stuff in the shop.
our order;
maple chicken strips - 9/10 the maple is CRAZY GOOD, the hint of spice, the softness of the chicken. its like heaven in your mouth
maple chicken burger - 9/10 following the maple strips, the burger was super delicious; fav burger from the ones we tried. the brioche bun was chefs kiss
cheese fries - 9/10 something we don‚Äôt usually like, cause none of the restaurants actually use good cheese (it always ends up tasting horrible) but this cheese fries was the best cheese fries we have had in AD. super addicting, you can‚Äôt stop eating
smokey burger - 8.5/10 if you are a fan of bbq sauce, def go for this! personally, i liked this more than the sweet bacon burger but it really depends on preference. my friend felt like it was a bit basic tho but still yummy
sweet bacon - 8.5/10 very unique burger in the sense not everyone would be a huge fan, my friend liked it more than the smokey burger
frosties milkshake - 8/10 super nostalgic drink, only thing is that it is a bit sweet for our liking
berry iced tea - 7/10 the flavoring was stronger than the tea, not exactly a big fan
overall, delicious food, amazing staff, and passed the vibe check.

The Fried Chicken was crispy on the top, soft and succulent inside and one can taste the freshness in every bite. The CRMBZ crinkle fries was huge and tasty.
The smashed beef patty was so juicy and yummy and nicely caramelized, it smothered well with the Potato Bun.

Went there for dinner with friends. Started off with their dips (the trio). We chose Tzatziki, Melitzanosalata and Beetroot Skordalia. Incredible way to start off the meal! The waiters were generous with bread but we were a big group and when we asked for more break they kind enough to provide a big plate; no questions asked! Next up; starters/ salads: Feta cheese wrapped in Phyllo, Keftedes and Dakos. DIVINE! The presentation, attention to detail and the flavor hit strong! We started feeling full but we got ecstatic for the main course once the waiters brought them over: Moussaka and Souvlaki Platter. We chose these two specifically to test the authenticity of Greek food and boy did they deliver! Moussaka was creamy, cheesy and the filling was on point! The Souvlaki Platter hit the nail. While the rice was zesty and delicious, the skewers were a game changer. I can't recall the last time I've had such tender meat! Super filling! By that time we were convinced that we've had enough but their head waiter, Panos, strongly recommended we don't leave until we've had - at least - one of their unique desserts. He personally recommended the Bougasta. Cannot thank him enough for the recommendation! Would have certainly been disappointed if I left and missed out! The generous vanilla pastry cream worked super well with the phyllo (covered in cinnamon powder) and to top it all off a scoop of - one of a kind - cinnamon ice cream made our night! Was a delightful experience and will definitely be back sooner than later!

The food was amazing , the service , the ambience, and the staff were so friendly and professional. The owners are everywhere around the customers.
I ordered the pastitsio croquette, which was super delicious and well presented. The BOUGATSA was out of this world ; the stuffing inside is super tasty with the cinnamon ice cream on the side. What a dessert.
The drinks were super creative and well balanced; the coffee as well.
There is an outdoor and indoor area ; it's a great option for family gatherings , dating, or special occasions.

Also make sure to ask them to bring food together, otherwise you will end up with eating mezza, stop and wait at least 10 minutes to get grills (worst experience ever) . I will also warn families with children. The  ""non smoking area"" is very small, and it's almost impossible to find a table. They will ask you to sit and wait with children in the smoking area until your table is ready.

We sat down on fri night with great expectations and were not very pleased with the restaurant given that it‚Äôs part of a chain like St. Regis no less.
Firstly the name is deceptive- ‚Äúthe terrace‚Äù happens to be on the ground floor and doesn‚Äôt have any feel of its name - at least during these summer months. The website has pictures of the exterior sitting but due to the heat it must have been off limits.
Call it cozy you may, but the first impression upon entering the restaurant was a cramped dining area with table too close to each other leaving no room to walk between them - rendering everyone to use the buffet aisle resulting in a jam.
Then we were told it‚Äôs an international buffet On Fridays which actually turned out to be a continental buffet far from being an international cuisine. As there were no stations for Indian food or Chinese for that matter. Ironically their website only has pictures of sushi platters and Indian dishes.
It‚Äôs hard to believe an international buffet to not have biryani or tandoori dishes let alone dedicated Indian stations or sushi and sashimi for that matter. Ironically. Which by the way are aplenty in the other five star restaurants like at the fairmont (CuiScene) or the Marriott Alfirsan (Khayal) or the JW Marriott Marquis Hotel Dubai (kitchen 6). We assume St. Regis would be in the same league but boy we were wrong.
To be fair to them the salad was nice and the service was available at an arms length. Loved the salmon with lemon dish and seafood. The Arabic salad was very tasty but the smoked salmons didn‚Äôt the other raw fish were both hardened with exposure to air. There were no prawns in the salads nor any prawns dish by itself save some prawns in one of the main dishes. We asked for rotis or naans and were served ready to cook Lulu parathas of sorts which was a dampener.
The pasta station was good for the kids so that kept them busy and the best part of the buffet was the dessert which was awesome.
Overall we probably chose the wrong day to dine there but the buffet was certainly not worth the price. So unless you are on a diet and want to eat just the salad and the dessert and wiling to dish out AED 195 per pax be my guest.",3.0,5 years ago,"d43d71987023a4a7d306914f75a5c8,8997b656474e789215fa8374cb00f2,04620a98a09b51c659a57f497885d3,1111c7bbba08a01baad93d795a144f,201aed186d3cc2bd90f7de3049233f,ac622b2930be59565a8bc589085c05,6f729991e672bf58bd442e549de2c8,7617e8d3c0c270a01142d83139acff,c806d4fa2987a359085e15894e5c3c"

Mehari, who served us was very friendly and explain me lot of Ethiopian  food  and culture. Injera was full of flavors, really totally different taste of west or east kitchen. I loved, it was little spicy, fresh,  but that's the way that should be. We was eating with fingers..no fork, no knifes, because all is already put in very small pieces, it's all cooked so long, that's al became like smashed potatoes. The bread was top of food..Sour taste an like a big pancake. It's go perfect with spicy ingridients. On end we drinked home made ""wine"" from honey, venegar and water.
